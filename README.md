# rainy-city

Have you ever wanted to live with that rainy city 𝔸𝕖𝕤𝕥𝕙𝕖𝕥𝕚𝕔?

That's where rainy-city.com comes in and saves the day.

With both rain and city sounds and a bustling city, you will never run out of a good time.

## Getting started

if you want to run this you can go to rainy-city.com.

if that doesn't work clone the repo then in the root directory of the repo run:

```
npm install
npm start
```

you might have to add other stuff. At the current moment, I am still figuring this all out.
